## How It Works

1. Enter a URL into the input field
2. Click the "Go!" button
3. Wait for the content to be fetched and processed
4. The extracted text will appear in the text area
5. Click "Copy" to copy the content to your clipboard

## Use Cases

- Content curation
- Quick text extraction from web pages

## Advanced Features
